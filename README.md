US Police Shooting Project

The Dataset I Use : "US Police Shooting - Copy.xlsx"

This Repository Will Hold My SQL Queries, Datasets, Etc.

In This Project, I Take Some Datasets From Kaggle, Clean It, And Visualize It

I Encounter Many Problem, Such As:

IN SQL:

-Same Name ,Example : "Taser" , "Tasered" To "Taser" [] "Gunshot, Beanbag Gun" , " Gunshot, Bean Bag Gun" To "Gunshot Beanbag"

-Changing Ages To Range ,Example : "18" to 18-24, "30" to 25-34

-Deleting Typo Data ,Example : "White" In Gender Column, "16-20-2018" In Race Column <> Since It Only Happen To Less Than 10 Row , If It More Than That , Then Fix The Typo.

IN Tableau:

-Cannot Make Pie Chart Because There Are Problem.

-Making Pie Chart To Display Percentage Rather Than Number
